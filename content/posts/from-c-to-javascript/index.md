Yo, My name is Roma and I'm a 23yo software engineer from Tbilisi, Georgia.

My introduction to programming world were video games and algorithms and tools for getting what I wanted were C/C++. After finding first work, not only I Improved my C skills but got familiarized with linux & system programming in general. Several years ago I was straight out of school writing C. Young guy writing on C in 2013, weird and rare, and I liked it.

Soon I got into very interesting project which was about doing hardware and software for whole country's public transport system(subway & bus payments, admission, monitoring and so on). I was in a good team writing software in embedded environment. I could not have wished for better.

University graduation came and I had to do a final project. I wanted to do something visually appealing for non-technical people and I wanted it done as soon as possible, I was working and did not have much free time to do something massive for final project. I came with an idea, platform where people post their tasks and others do it. Like Quora, but instead of asking questions and answering you ask someone to get something done. It's a web platform and obviously I have to learn something new. I'm feeling easy, I've been writing production-grade software for 4mb RAM, without third party libraries and packages, obviously I create a little site. That was my thought process and boy was I mistaken.

I started learning Javascript. No memory management, no long hours of setting up environments, no static type checking, asynchronous mindset of Nodejs, great packages, great community, ever-growing and nurturing ecosystem. Writing and seeing what you have created is faster, you see results sooner, feedback loop is faster. I have been impressed by the ecosystem ever since.

Learning process was hard, learning process is hard. JS ecosystem is tremendous and it's so easy to bite off more than you can chew. There were moments when I was overwhelmed, there were moments when I opened my good ole Clion and started coding C. But I refused to spend time on managing memory, I was adamant on using only stack allocations. I refused to spend time on cmake, on anything but business logic. That was the luxury I had with JS, most of my time as a developer being spent on business logic.

I love javascript, I love the direction we are heading. One day I will wake up and the only thing I will have to worry about as a software engineer will be pure business logic.
