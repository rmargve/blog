Yo, we all love meat. It's unimaginable to live without meat, unless you imagine it.

After several months of plant-based diet I'm gonna share my thoughts

## Self-discipline ##

I learn to tell myself no. We should all strive to have more control upon our emotions & actions.

## Body feels better ##

Humans been eating plants much longer and can digest it better, eating plants not only reduces health issues(you can do your research on this, I'm not gonna provide any proofs here), but grants more energy & potency. Even if my body is not "healthier", I still get benefits of being positive about looking after my health and body.

## Animal exploitation ##

It's about empathy too, I feel better when I care about other beings

## New environment ##

I learn about new culture, I see things from new perspectives, it's like exploration, I'm broadening my horizon. Next time someone tells me that he/she is vegan, I won't laugh and say "let me educate you how important is living by constrains I live by"

## Measurement unit ##

It tells you about people surrounding you, You detect people with mindset who has hard time putting up with someone who "is not alike". I don't know how to explain this well but in a nutshell it tells you about people's attitude to **difference**



And also, all these egocentric reasons I talked about are a proof that you don't have to be altruistic or have noble intentions to go vegan ðŸ˜…
