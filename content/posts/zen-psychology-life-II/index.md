## Part Two

_Disclaimer_: article, while written and told by me, is heavily inspired by Erich Fromm’s book “Zen Buddhism & Psychoanalysis”.

Hunger or pain is easy to feel, but not all sensations are. Feelings, which are aspects of our personality and which we deem valuable are more comprehensible than feelings, which have no matching words in our culture. Some are felt less, some are felt more. Our consciousness and capability for feelings are products of our environment.

Culture and language influence our way of thinking and perceiving world. Having as many identities as many languages one is able to speak is not that far from the truth. Some cultures emphasize nouns in sentences, as they do material things in real life, some don’t have time concept, of course their way of thinking will be different from people who have to deal with past, present or future in every sentence. Different cultures have different set of values, things and feelings important to them are understood in a more concise, deeper way.

> Yuan bei (Chinese) – a sense of complete and perfect accomplishment

> Natsukashii (Japanese) – a nostalgic longing for the past, with happiness for the fond memory, yet sadness that it is no longer

> Sukha (Sanskrit) – genuine lasting happiness independent of circumstances

Logics, useful for reasoning, is also our prison. Anything beyond it called incomprehensible and paradoxical, logics effectively keeps us away from pondering on things it can not explain. Since Aristotle, Westerners, akin to dualism, consider holding contradictory beliefs irrational. In general, eastern mind is more open to concept of [non-dualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-duality). [Heraclitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus) was known for his paradoxical philosophy, as was [Johann Fichte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis,_antithesis,_synthesis). Not everything can be expressed by words and not everything can be contained by imposed rules of logics. In order to grasp concepts incoherent to us, we should not fear to go beyond limitations of language and logics.

Human experiences transform our view of reality. Every society has taboos, forbidden actions, forbidden thoughts. Imagine a tribe involved in killing and robbing others. A tribe member may feel hatred towards himself for doing such things, will he understand concisely what he feels or will he, in fear of isolation and oppression from his peers, redirect his feeling of anxiety into something totally different, for example psychosomatic feeling of vomit. Will an abbot, uncertain in his faith, try to answer his questions with facts and reality, or oppress uncertainty and strengthen his belief in god? Will a human, living in a society where everything has a price, think that what he does is an unselfish act of love, or will he decide that he does is for his satisfaction.

Thus, we can say that thoughts, before finding abode in our consciousness, go through these filters of language, logics and society. Anything that does not pass censure of these filters, according to Freud, are [repressed](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repression_(psychology)>) to unconscious. From unconscious it slowly pours into conscious, often in ugly and transformed ways.

_Addendum from author_: Society wants us to fulfil our social functions by our own will, without direct enforcement. Church wants us to be religious by our choice. Tribes, engaged in war, want us to be a killing machine by our own will. Thus, every society, in fear of endangerment, has its own set of unwritten rules, going against with which, brings to [ostracism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostracism).
Usually, when majority is ruled by minority, majority’s consciousness is manipulated into thinking that adhering to imposed rules is beneficial to everyone. By opressing individuality, and heightening senses of social animalness, we are expected to comply with rules written and unwritten, we are expected to be shaped after one mold. And it’s effectively coupled with our innate fear of isolation and loneliness, we willingly castrate our individualism to fit in. Unless we break from the chains we never asked to be in, and either become an outcast, or prove our worth as individuals to society and be called an innovative person, pioneer, modern mind, euphemism for useful outcast from the same time and society.
