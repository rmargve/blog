## Part One

_Disclaimer_: article, while written and told by me, is heavily inspired by Erich Fromm’s book “Zen Buddhism & Psychoanalysis”.

Confident in my abilities, I’ve always admired my intellect and absolutely everything around me was subject of my rationalization. Only recently, have I come to revelation that rationalization and overthinking have a sole purpose: making world around us more tolerable. Trying to penetrate essence of things around me and have better understanding of them, I always had my intellect primed and more I resorted to my mental abilities to define and analyze surrounding world, more confident I felt. Until I started noticing patterns. Distorting reality for it to meet my needs. Aim of my so called rationalization was never to gain insight, but to output a fabricated world, more comfortable to live in. With this realization, I am shattering my illusion of superiority in my illusory world and acknowledge that world and reality as is, is much more interesting than living and dying in Plato’s cave. This is a beginning of my quest to dive deeper into human spirit, emotions, conscious and unconscious, to soothe a suffering of a man, keen to western rationalism, with eastern spiritualism.

Animals, unlike humans, are one with nature. They comply with it, live by its rules, in short, their life is led by it. We don’t submit to nature, we want to lead our lives by ourselves. With realization of our individualism, we are destined to feel loneliness and alienation to ourselves and outer world. For whole life, we try to ease and suppress feeling of loneliness and alienation caused by separation from nature. This desire can lead us to madness, complete detachment from reality, suicide, attachment to motherly love, submission to father figure or shifting focus to material possessions and social statuses.

Living in an environment, where “having” is inseparable part of “being”, where materialism and rationalism is of such importance, makes us even more vulnerable to spiritual crises, manifestation of which are anxiety, depression and other disorders.

> [“Mal du siècle (French: [mal dy sjɛkl], "sickness of the century") is a term used to refer to the ennui, disillusionment, and melancholy experienced by primarily young adults of Europe's early 19th century”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal_du_si%C3%A8cle)

Alienation may lead us to [regression](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_(psychology)>) and suppress our current consciousness, morals, views. Examples of this are religions with fatherly figure who demands total obedience and suppression of any individualism, or cults with aggressive, animal-like behavior, totem worshipping, killing rituals. Such groups try to distance itself from future, reform, advancements. Instead they prefer to embrace and glorify past. Anything that helps them regain connection with their primal selves, nature or transcendental figure is sacred. And a person closest to the goal is deemed a saint. In the opposite camp would be sciences, philosophies and religions with belief that humans can be in harmony with self and nature not by means of regression, but by tapping into our inner world and being reborn with higher consciousness.

In the next chapters I’m going to talk about what does Sigmund Freud have in common with Zen Buddhism, transforming our unconscious into conscious, getting rid of filters which alter our perception and distort perceived reality in order to achieve awakening, [Satori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satori).
