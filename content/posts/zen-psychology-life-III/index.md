## Part Three

\- Would you take a blue pill or red pill?  
\- Red pill, go on, reveal the unpleasant truth, but wait, let me keep my defence mechanisms, so I can bring into play psychological strategies to manipulate, deny, or distort reality in order to defend against feelings of anxiety and unacceptable impulses and to maintain one's self-schema or other schemas.

_“We are aware of reality to the extent to which the goal of survival makes such awareness necessary”._

When we see a ball rolling, we assume that it’s the ball moving, not the surface. When we see trees passing from train’s window, we assume it’s a train moving, not trees. Who deploys such tricks against us? right, cinematographers.


Do you think sometimes that taste consists of two components: first - the “real” taste of product, another - your expectations of how will it taste? Do you like or dislike whatever you are eating? **Your attitude is a major player here**. People living in cold places are much more tolerant to cold weather, do you think you would have been more tolerant too if you knew that “coldness” was inseparable part of your daily life?

What I want to say is that we have a power to manipulate reality to reduce our anxiety. I spent several weeks walking with t-shirt in winter, one of the precursors that helped me befriend the cold was that one morning I found out that boiler did not work and I had to take cold bath.

I’m gonna copy five main defence mechanisms shamelessly from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_mechanism) now

_All defence mechanisms are responses to anxiety and how the consciousness and unconscious manage the stress of a social situation._

> Repression: when a feeling is hidden and forced from the consciousness to the unconscious because it is seen as socially unacceptable

Do you clearly remember what happened when you were really embarrassed that day?

> Regression: falling back into an early state of mental/physical development seen as "less demanding and safer”

Do you like whining sometimes like a little child?

> Projection: possessing a feeling that is deigned as socially unacceptable and instead of facing it, that feeling or "unconscious urge" is seen in the actions of other people

Do you remember that bully from the school? Was he not projecting his own weakness onto others?

> Reaction formation: acting the opposite way that the unconscious instructs a person to behave, "often exaggerated and obsessive".

Do you remember more angry you felt about coworker more politeness you tried to show while communicating? No, no, better example: How many gay people in your local area are preaching that homosexuality is sin?

> Sublimation: seen as the most acceptable of the mechanisms, an expression of anxiety in socially acceptable ways

Have you heard about clerical celibacy? It’s based on an idea to redirect sexual energy into something more spiritual and creative.

Also, I loved watching Dexter(tv show) as a child, it was about a serial killer, who redirected his insatiable hunger to kill people into killing criminals. Way more acceptable and productive, is not it? It was me trying to joke here, thanks.

Speaking of sublimation and redirecting energies, ever wondered why couples, especially new ones, fight often? Because their emotions towards each other charge them with so much energy, that they do not know how to handle it and end up releasing those energies in ugly ways. Master how to release accumulated energies and you won’t talk to your significant other like Ben Shapiro debating. It was me joking again.

p.s. check out more about pathological, immature, neurotic, mature [defence mechanisms on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_mechanism#Vaillant's_categorization), it’s interesting, really.
